# Time Series and Optimal-Stopping-Theory-Models Anlysis

## Executables

- simulation_tool.py
- time-series_analysis.py

These executables were built using ipython module.
To run open a command prompt window in the directory and run:

```bash
$ ipython simulation_tool.py
```
```bash
$ ipython time-series_analysis.py
```
In case there is a change in the code you can convert the .ipynbs to scripts by running the following command:

```bash
$ ipython nbconvert --to script thescript.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions on the screen when you run the executables.

In case you don't have ipython install it with:

```bash
$ pip3 install ipython
```
